- **READ THIS FOR ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION** - https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/tower-defense/implementation.html

- **PYGAME DOCUMENTATION**
https://www.pygame.org/docs/index.html

- maybe this will help with drawing walls: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24301702/walls-in-pygame

- THIS LOOKS REALLY GOOD BUT I HAVENT READ IT YET. IT INCLUDES STUFF ON PATH FINDING AND HONESTLY WE COULD PROBABLY JUST MAKE A DUPLICATE OF THIS GAME BUT LIKE MAKE IT ALL MARIO AND WHATEVER ELSE

## TODO BY TUESDAY
- [x] got stuff started
- [x] drew temp ~~circles~~ rectangles? for characters???
- [x] platforms drawn (randomly generated or no? we could just have one level) ~~[use tic tac toe for reference. could use/generate a board with a 2D array? only issue would be super slow running time O(n^2) or something like that i think]~~
- [ ] txt file with screen coordinates that will act as vertices and edges
- [x] have player/keyboard movement working properly
- [ ] make sure player cant go through walls/platforms [pong for reference]
- [ ] randomly generate moving fireballs/barrels at varying speed(s) [see pong/alien invasion file for reference]
- [ ] ***generate graph - use least cost path / dijkstra mayhaps for fireballs/barrels [use assign 1 as reference i guess]***

## TODO BY THE END OF THE WEEK/WEEKEND
- [ ] player jumping stuff if we arent doing something like a maze?
- [ ] endgame conditions (i.e. getting to peach)
- [ ] how are we killing donkey kong???????? or are we just tryna get to peach
