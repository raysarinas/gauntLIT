- [x] have player/keyboard movement working properly
- [ ] make sure player cant go through walls/platforms [pong for reference]
- [ ] randomly generate moving fireballs/barrels at varying speed(s) [see pong/alien invasion file for reference]
- [ ] generate graph - use least cost path / dijkstra mayhaps for fireballs/barrels [use assign 1 as reference i guess]

## TODO BY THE END OF THE WEEK/WEEKEND
