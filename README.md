CMPUT 275 FINAL PROJECT (the last time zac tries it with bonus pain from omid)

- **READ THIS FOR ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION** - https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/tower-defense/implementation.html

- **PYGAME DOCUMENTATION**
https://www.pygame.org/docs/index.html

- maybe this will help with drawing walls: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24301702/walls-in-pygame

- THIS LOOKS REALLY GOOD BUT I HAVENT READ IT YET. IT INCLUDES STUFF ON PATH FINDING AND HONESTLY WE COULD PROBABLY JUST MAKE A DUPLICATE OF THIS GAME BUT LIKE MAKE IT ALL MARIO AND WHATEVER ELSE

## DONE BY TUESDAY
- [x] got stuff started
- [x] ~~drew temp rectangles? for characters???~~
- [x] platforms drawn (randomly generated or no? we could just have one level) ~~[use tic tac toe for reference. could use/generate a board with a 2D array? only issue would be super slow running time O(n^2) or something like that i think]~~
- [x] have player/keyboard movement working properly
- [x] make sure player cant go through walls/platforms ~~[pong for reference]~~

## TODO BY THE END OF THE WEEK/WEEKEND
- [ ] txt file with screen coordinates that will act as vertices and edges
- [ ] **ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION (Breadth First Search / Dijkstra?)**
- [ ] randomly moving fireball
- [ ] endgame conditions (i.e. getting to peach or dying?)

## TODO BY TUESDAY OR THURSDAY?
- [x] sprite importing and making sure they move properly
- [ ] multiple fireballs every x amount of seconds that will breadth-first search player
