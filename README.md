## TODO BY TUESDAY
- [x] got stuff started
- [x] drew temp circles for characters???
- [ ] platforms drawn (randomly generated or no? we could just have one level) [use tic tac toe for reference. could use/generate a board with a 2D array? only issue would be super slow running time O(n^2) or something like that i think]
- [ ] txt file with screen coordinates that will act as vertices and edges
- [ ] have player/keyboard movement working properly [pong for reference]
- [ ] make sure player cant go through walls/platforms [pong for reference]
- [ ] randomly generate moving fireballs/barrels at varying speed(s) [see pong/alien invasion file for reference]
- [ ] generate graph - use least cost path / dijkstra mayhaps for fireballs/barrels [use assign 1 as reference i guess]

## TODO BY THE END OF THE WEEK/WEEKEND
